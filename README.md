# connect-four
This is my connect four project from the Odin Project

To perform my tests, cd into the base folder for the game and type 'rspec spec/spec.rb'

To play the game, uncomment the line '# game.play' at the bottom of the connect_four.rb
script, cd into the base folder, and type 'ruby connect_four.rb'
